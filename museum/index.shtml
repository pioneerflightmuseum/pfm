    <p>The Pioneer Flight Museum has acquired an original World War I hangar 
    to serve as the museum building. The structure has been moved to the museum
    grounds, and will be re-built and restored. A concrete slab has
    been poured to serve as the museum foundation, and PFM is
    seeking donations to help cover the cost of raising the
    building.</p>

    <p>This picture shows an aerial view of Dodd Field taken in the early 20th
    century.  The black building at the north end of the field is the hangar that
    we have acquired.  After Dodd Field was closed, this building was dismantled
    and moved to Fort Sam Houston.  Over the years, it was moved several times,
    and served a variety of purposes for the Army.  PFM will use the hangar as
    its primary exhibit building, housing the non-flying and historical artifacts owned by
    the foundation.
