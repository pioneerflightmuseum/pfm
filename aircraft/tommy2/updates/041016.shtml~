    <h1>October 16, 2004 Project Update</h1>
    
    <p>Most of our project effort so far has been concentrated on the two Fokker
    projects, but we have done a bit of work on the Tommy.  Bill Broussard spent 
    quite a bit of time continuing to prepare the tail surface components of
	 both "Tommys" for covering.  Lots of metal fittings that need cloth patches 
	 glued over them and trimmed. This process is almost done....
