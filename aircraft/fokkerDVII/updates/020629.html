    <p>This is kind of a multi-week update, since we've had a couple of
    work weeks since the last report.  On the weekend of June 22nd,
    Bill Broussard, Wayne Jones, and Tom Gaylord were all available to
    work on the D.VII.  They did some finish work on the tail surfaces,
    especially working on the covering and painting of the fin and
    rudder.  This picture shows Wayne Jones masking the hinges on the
    rudder prior to painting it.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>The team also began working on the control column.  On June 29th,
    Bill Broussard was able to return to Old Kingsbury Aerodrome to
    continue working on the control column.  Plans for the next work
    weekend are to finish the lower part of the column, including finishing
    and welding the attach points for the ailerons and elevator.  Once those
    are added, the control lines to the elevators can be run and the
    penetration points of the upper and lower horizontal stabilizer
    can be determined.  The wooden gap seal on the horizontal stabilizer
    was also modified to correct some minor problems.  Once the control
    lines are established, the elevator and horizontal stabilizer can
    be covered.
